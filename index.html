My interests in are in Statistics, mainly in applied statistics.

My favorite formula in statistics is likely Bayes' Theorem which is written below. 
\[ P(A\mid B) = \dfrac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \]

I find it a rather interesting formula as it allows us to compute probabilities in a more natural way. Typically, we have some information about the event
we are looking to analyze, so properly understanding how to utilize given information when computing probabilities allows us to conduct better analysis of data.
